Questions:

1. What are the three main design advantages that object orientation can provide? 
Explain each concept.
- abstraction: you don't have to know everything in order to perform a task
- encapsulation: small batch of self contained code
- polymorphism: one batch of code can be used to produce multiple outputs

2. What is a class?
- A standalone grouping of code that provides a reusable structure comprised
of attributes (class attributes and instance attributes)

3. What is an instance attribute?
- An attribute that belongs to the current instance of a class

4. What is a method?
- a function within a class

5. What is an instance in object orientation?
- a "copy" of a class that inherits all the class' attributes

6. How is a class attribute different than an instance attribute? Give an example of when you might use each.
- a class attribute is usable by all instances of that class. An instance attribute is only usable on itself.
